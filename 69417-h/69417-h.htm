<h2 class="platedesc" title="Plate I."><a href="#plI" id="pltI">PLATE I</a>.</h2>

<p class="newchap"><span class="dropcap">Plan</span> and elevation of a hut, to be built with trunks of
trees and irregular timber. The inside walls may be
lined with moss, and covered on the top with thatch. It is
intended to represent the primitive state of the Doric Order,
and is proper to be placed at the entrance of a wood, or on
the top of a small eminence. The dimensions are figured
on the plan.</p>


<h2 class="platedesc" title="Plate II."><a href="#plII" id="pltII">PLATE II</a>.</h2>

<p>Plan and elevation of an hermetic retreat, to be composed
of roots and irregular branches of trees, cemented together
with a strong binding clay, and may be thatched or covered
with branches of trees twined round with ivy. The dimensions
are figured on the plan.</p>


<h2 class="platedesc" title="Plate III."><a href="#plIII" id="pltIII">PLATE III</a>.</h2>

<p>Elevation of an hermitâ€™s cell, with rustic seats attached,
eight feet square in the inside, which should be situated in
a rising wood near some running water, to be built partly of
large stones and trunks of trees, set round with ivy, and
lined with rushes, &amp;c. The roof should be covered with
thatch, and the floor paved with small pebble stones or
cockle shells. The seats attached are intended to be composed
of large irregular stones, roots of <span class="nw">trees, &amp;c.</span></p>


<h2 class="platedesc" title="Plate IV."><a href="#plIV" id="pltIV">PLATE IV</a>.</h2>

<p>Plan and elevation for an hermitage, in the eastern style,
supposed to be built round a tree which supports its roof;
over the door is a tablet, with an Arabic inscription; the
roof is covered with thatch, in the Chinese taste; the inside
to be lined with billet wood and moss. It is lighted from
the lanterns above. A. should be a couch; B. C. are seats
of retirement. The dimensions are figured in the plan. The
rustic seats on the side are intended to be composed of large
rough stones and roots of pollard trees cemented together.</p>


<h2 class="platedesc" title="Plate V."><a id="p4" href="#p4"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p</span>4<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a><a href="#plV" id="pltV">PLATE V</a>.</h2>

<p>Plan and elevation of a winter hermitage, intended as a
retirement from hunting, fowling, or any other winter amusement;
the walls to be built of flints or rough stones, and
lined with wood or other warm substance intermixed with
moss, and should be situated on a rising ground planted
with evergreens.</p>


<h2 class="platedesc" title="Plate VI."><a href="#plVI" id="pltVI">PLATE VI</a>.</h2>

<p>Plan and elevation of a summer hermitage, designed to be
in a wilderness or thick wood; the walls to be composed of
large stones, and the ends faced with flints; the roof covered
with thatch, and an owl carved on the top; the floor should
be paved with sheeps<!-- TN: sic --> marrow-bones placed upright, or any
other pretty devices intermixed with them. A. is for a couch;
B. C. are seats of retirement.</p>


<h2 class="platedesc" title="Plate VII."><a href="#plVII" id="pltVII">PLATE VII</a>.</h2>

<p>Plan and elevation of an hermitage in the Augustine style;
the front is ornamented with a portico of palm trees; in the
pediment is a scull, and a tablet with an inscription. A. A.
are passages of evergreens leading to the two circular retreats,
one of which is intended as a library, and the other
a bath; the tops of them are intended to be thatched;
b b b. are niches for seats cut in the evergreens. This design
is calculated to be built on a small verdant amphitheatre,
near a murmuring stream, and as a proper retreat from
the fatigues of a sultry day.</p>


<h2 class="platedesc" title="Plate VIII."><a href="#plVIII" id="pltVIII">PLATE VIII</a>.</h2>

<p>A plan, half an elevation, and half a section, of a rural
circular hermitage, designed for an open situation near some
rivulet, planted with weeping willows, &amp;c. The inside is
lighted by a gazebo, supported by eight trunks of trees
twined about with ivy. The dimensions are figured on the
plan.</p>


<h2 class="platedesc" title="Plate IX."><a href="#plIX" id="pltIX">PLATE IX</a>.</h2>

<p>Plan, elevation, and section, of a grotto in a modern
architectonic style, ornamented with jet dâ€™eaux, sea weeds,
looking-glass, fountains, and other grotesque decorations.
The dimensions may be known by the scale and the figures
on the plan.</p>


<h2 class="platedesc" title="Plate X."><a href="#plX" id="pltX">PLATE X</a>.</h2>

<p>Plan and elevation of a Gothic grotto, with four closets
five feet square; the outside to be composed of flints and
irregular stones, and studded with small pebbles; the inside
to be ornamented with shells, ores, &amp;c. and if built upon an
eminence, it would have a very pleasing appearance.</p>

<p>Plan and elevation of an open Chinese grotto, to be placed
at the head of a grand canal, with a bath (A), and a Chinese
temple (B), attached; the arcades to be ice or frosted work;
the outside of the bath and temple to be ornamented with
beautiful shells in the Mosaic taste; the inside to be groined
over, as on the plan, and ornamented with shell-work and
other beautiful incrustations. The whole extent is <span class="nw">75 feet.</span></p>

<p>Plan and measures to plate <a href="#plXIII">xiii</a>. and <a href="#plXIV">xiv</a>.</p>


<h2 class="platedesc" title="Plate XIII."><a href="#plXIII" id="pltXIII">PLATE XIII</a>.</h2>

<p>Elevation of a Gothic grotto, with cascades and wings
attached (<i>see the plan, plate</i> <a href="#plXII">xii</a>.) The entrance is a saloon
of 20 feet square; the angles are couped with off niches,
where grotesque statues or vases should be placed. It is
intended to have a fountain in the centre, with antique figures
spouting out water; the walls should be lined with flints,
decorated with ice-work; the whole is lighted from a gazebo
on the top. A. B. are the plans of the two wings or repositories,
which are each descended to by a flight of four steps.
A. is intended to be ornamented with curious shells, gems,
coral, &amp;c. with statues in the niches. B. is to be groined
over in the Gothic manner, with a pier in the centre to be
lined with flints, intermixed with shells, looking-glass, &amp;c.
The groins should be incrusted with frosted work, in the
manner of dropping icicles. Both these wings are lighted
from the rose arches, as appears in the elevation; the outside
to be composed of rough stones incrusted and studded with
pebbles, shells, &amp;c. There are placed in the recesses Gothic
figures. The situation should be in some retired copse,
shaded by an adjacent hill, near some murmuring rivulet,
where the cascades, or rather fountains, as in the design,
may be easily effected. The measures are marked on the
plan.</p>


<h2 class="platedesc" title="Plate XIV."><a href="#plXIV" id="pltXIV">PLATE XIV</a>.</h2>

<p>Elevation of a rural grotto (<i>see the plan, plate</i> <a href="#plXII">xii</a>.) which
should be built of large rough stones rudely put together, so
that the building may as near as possible imitate the beautiful
appearance of nature. If the dome was to be richly ornamented
with pendentive shell and frosted work, it would
look very elegant. In the middle niche is Neptune on a
rock, pouring out water, which descends under the pavement
through an arch, and forms a running stream. The side
niches are ornamented with satyrs and other grotesque figures.
The situation should be in a morass, near some water.</p>

<p>A design for a cascade or cataract of a great fall of
water, decorated with rock-work, sea lions pouring out
fountains of water; and a triton by way of embellishment,
in the centre.</p>


<h2 class="platedesc" title="Plate XVI."><a href="#plXVI" id="pltXVI">PLATE XVI</a>.</h2>

<p>A design for a triumphal cascade of four falls of water. If
care is taken to erect this arch with rude and irregular flints,
&amp;c. at the same time paying a due observance to nature, it
will have a very magnificent appearance, and look extremely
elegant; and would be a superb ornament in a
noblemanâ€™s park where there is a great supply of water.</p>


<h2 class="platedesc" title="Plate XVII."><a href="#plXVII" id="pltXVII">PLATE XVII</a>.</h2>

<p>A grotto, canal, and cascade, decorated with rock-work,
tritons, sybils, &amp;c. pouring forth fountains of water. The
author hopes he may be indulged with observing, that he
hath with great pleasure seen a fine piece of water in the
park of the Earl of <i>Essex</i>, at <i>Cashiobury</i>, near <i>Watford</i>,
<i>Herts</i>, and flatters himself, that if the arch in this design,
on which the triton is placed, was to be executed there in
the nature of a bridge, it would have a very magnificent
and pleasing appearance.</p>


<h2 class="platedesc" title="Plate XVIII."><a href="#plXVIII" id="pltXVIII">PLATE XVIII</a>.</h2>

<p>A romantic bridge, or a cascade of three sheets of water,
descending through arches of artificial rock-work, incrusted
with shells, corals, sea-weed, moss, &amp;c. and two sea gods
lying on their oozy couch, pouring out water.</p>


<h2 class="platedesc" title="Plate XIX."><a href="#plXIX" id="pltXIX">PLATE XIX</a>.</h2>

<p>Plan and elevation of a rustic seat for a garden or park,
intended to terminate a view. It would look very pretty if
it was built with flints, or irregular rude branches and roots
of trees.</p>


<h2 class="platedesc" title="Plate XX."><a href="#plXX" id="pltXX">PLATE XX</a>.</h2>

<p>Plan and elevation for a grotesque or rural bath, very
proper to be built in gardens, &amp;c. for the benefit of bathing.
It is intended to have three seats within, by way of closets,
for the convenience of dressing and undressing. If the water
in the plan be left out, it will look very pleasing as a rural
hut.</p>


<h2 class="platedesc" title="Plate XXI."><a href="#plXXI" id="pltXXI">PLATE XXI</a>.</h2>

<p>Plan and elevation of a rural mosque with minarets. It
is divided into an octagon saloon, supported by eight columns,
lighted from the dome. The other apartments are four regular
small rooms or closets, which will serve for various
<a id="p7" href="#p7"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p</span>7<span class="ns">] </span></span></a>purposes. The minarets are placed in the plan by way of
ornament, to shew the true taste of the Turkish buildings;
and the singularity of the style of architecture is such, that
will render it a very pleasing ornament, if executed in a
pleasure ground, or upon an elevated verdant amphitheatre.
It may be built of wood, and stuccoed; the inside should be
painted with various rich colours, which would have a pleasing
and elegant appearance. The dome is supported by
irregular branches of trees, well connected and cramped together.
The minarets should be solid, and the pedestals
(A. B.) should be decorated with Arabic inscriptions. For
a more intelligible and historical account of these buildings,
I must refer the reader to Dr. <i>Shawâ€™s</i> Account of <i>Barbary</i>,
<i>Le Brun</i> and <i>Tournefortâ€™s</i> Voyage to the <span class="nw"><i>Levant</i>, &amp;c.</span></p>


<h2 class="platedesc" title="Plate XXII."><a href="#plXXII" id="pltXXII">PLATE XXII</a>.</h2>

<p>Plan and elevation of a circular mosque twenty feet diameter,
with four cabinets attached, eight feet square; two
of which may serve for entrances, having each a small fountain,
five feet diameter; the other two may be for the purposes
of study or use. The four minarets at the angles bring
the plan upon the square of forty feet. The cabinets, as well
as the mosque, are crowned with domes, which should be
gilt on the outside. The great dome is supported by eight
columns, over which are groined arches; an iron balustrade
runs round the outside, which may be painted blue, and
gilt; on the top of the great dome is a light cupola, supported
by eight small columns, from whence hangs a chandelier
to light the inside when required. The other decorations
may be seen in the section, plate <a href="#plXXIV">xxiv</a>.</p>


<h2 class="platedesc" title="Plate XXIII."><a href="#plXXIII" id="pltXXIII">PLATE XXIII</a>.</h2>

<p>Plan and elevation for another mosque, with two minarets
attached to the body of the building, which may be executed
in brick of 14 inches thickness. The front is a portico of
four columns, in the oriental style, in the centre of which
is a fountain for sabateons; which may be seen in the section,
plate <a href="#plXXIV">xxiv</a>. The niches in the front should have Arabic
inscriptions in gold letters. The portico is covered with
three little domes, in the Turkish manner, ornamented with
crescents, &amp;c. The inside is lighted from the circular windows
and little arches above, which support the dome. For
the interior decoration, see the section, plate <a href="#plXXIV">xxiv</a>. It
would look very beautiful if built on an open lawn, planted
round with a few cypress or other exotic trees. The dimensions
are figured on the plan.</p>


<h2 class="platedesc" title="Plate XXIV."><a id="p8" href="#p8"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p</span>8<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a><a href="#plXXIV" id="pltXXIV">PLATE XXIV</a>.</h2>

<p>Sections and scales to plates <a href="#plXXII">xxii</a>. and <a href="#plXXIII">xxiii</a>.</p>


<h2 class="platedesc" title="Plate XXV."><a href="#plXXV" id="pltXXV">PLATE XXV</a>.</h2>

<p>Two plans of moresque temples to plates <a href="#plXXVI">xxvi</a>. and <a href="#plXXVII">xxvii</a>.
with their proper measures.</p>


<h2 class="platedesc" title="Plate XXVI."><a href="#plXXVI" id="pltXXVI">PLATE XXVI</a>.</h2>

<p>Elevation of a beautiful moresque temple (<i>see the plan,
plate</i> <a href="#plXXV">xxv</a>.) The coupled columns support an arcade of intersecting
semi-ellipses, which goes quite round the temple.
In the spandrells are Moors heads, with crescents, roses,
and stars, over which is a parapet balustrade of net or lattice-work.
The body of the temple is 20 feet diameter,
crowned with an open lantern, from whence it is lighted;
the outside of which is adorned with stars of glass of an
azure ground. On the top is a pine, which should be double
gilt; and if the outside was covered with a glossy substance,
it would have a very pleasing and magnificent appearance.
The style of architecture is a medium between the Chinese
and Gothic, having neither the levity of the former nor the
gravity of the latter. The particularities of both this and
the following design are taken from those famous remains of
barbarian antiquity, the palace of <i>Alhambra</i>, at <i>Granada</i>,
the ancient moresque mosque at <i>Cordova</i>, the old cassavee
or palace of the <i>Moorish</i> kings at <i>MÃ¦quanez</i>; for the accounts
of which the reader is referred to <i>Willughbuyâ€™s</i> Travels
into <i>Spain</i>, <i>Ockleyâ€™s</i> Account of South or West <i>Barbary</i>,
and <i>Shawâ€™s</i> Travels to the <i>Levant</i>.</p>


<h2 class="platedesc" title="Plate XXVII."><a href="#plXXVII" id="pltXXVII">PLATE XXVII</a>.</h2>

<p>Elevation of a moresque pavilion (<i>see the plan, plate</i> <a href="#plXXV">xxv</a>.)
in the style of the ancient <i>Moors</i>, raised on three steps.
Over the arches are <i>Moors</i> heads and festoons. In the middle
is a circular or geometrical staircase, leading to the top, or
balustrade. It is crowned with a square cupola, mounted
with a moresque standard; and is very proper to be built on
an eminence to command an extensive view.</p>


<h2 class="platedesc" title="Plate XXVIII."><a href="#plXXVIII" id="pltXXVIII">PLATE XXVIII</a>.</h2>

<p>Plan and elevation for a green-house of the grotesque
kind, faced with flints and irregular stones. The dimensions
may be found by the scale.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>
